## Computer Vision Projects

<h3>Recyclable Waste Management</h3>
<img width = 1000 height = 250 alt="image" src="https://github.com/priyasjsu/priyasjsu.github.io/assets/113324576/444e22a1-aef5-4828-a3ed-c727d88705db"> <br/>
The rapid growth of the global population, urbanization, and improved living standards has led to a pressing issue: waste management. Predictions indicate that annual waste production will spike to 3.40 billion tons by 2050, from the current 2.01 billion tons. To address this issue, we are leveraging cutting-edge advances in deep learning, computer vision, and other technologies. Recyclingâ€”the process of repurposing and reusing trashâ€”is arguably one of the most effective mechanisms for reducing waste and improving waste management.
