<h1 align = "center">Hi there, I'm Priya KhandelwalðŸ‘‹</h1>
Passionate data alchemist, machine learning maven, and software sorcerer on a quest to turn code into insights and dreams into reality.
<h2> About Me: </h2>

I'm currently on an exhilarating journey, pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics at San Jose State University. My voyage into the world of data science has been enriched by 5 years of diving into data modelling, analysis, and software development. This blend of experience and innovation has given me a unique perspective.
My toolkit includes Statistics, Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. I've also explored the latest tech like GANs, CNNs, and Transformers. My hunger for knowledge led me to immerse myself in courses like Machine Learning Fundamentals, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, Big Data, and Statistics from DataCamp. These, along with hands-on learning, have fortified my skills.

I've ventured into different domains, from deciphering retail patterns and financial trends in banking to adding a touch of magic to the entertainment world and tackling real-world challenges like waste management. My digital portfolio on GitHub showcases my adventures, spotlighting my journey as a Data Specialist, Machine Learning Enthusiast, and Software Engineer.

At this moment, I'm fueled by a captivating project: crafting a bridge between sound and sign through Audio to American Sign Language conversion. It's a blend of NLP, Transformer magic, Neural Machine Translation, and the artistry of GANs, all working together to create a world of inclusivity. My passion for deep learning comes to life in projects like StyleGAN, JojoGAN, and Cartoon GAN, where I conjure captivating visuals from ordinary images.

This journey is perpetual, as the realm of data and technology knows no bounds. The quest for knowledge keeps me driven, with an insatiable thirst to weave impact through data wizardry and technological innovation. My GitHub profile is a living testament, a collection of stories that underscore my role as a Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Machine Learning Enthusiast.

From crafting Predictive Models to unlocking the potential of Computer Vision, from sculpting personalized experiences with Recommendation Systems to uncovering insights from text through Text Mining, and choreographing the flow of data in Data Pipelines, I'm committed to making a mark. My dedication resonates in every project. I'm all about bringing fresh ideas to life.

As I extend a digital hand to you, I invite you to join me in this adventure. Let's explore, learn, and create together in the mesmerizing world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Your interest in my portfolio means the world to me. Together, let's ride the waves of innovation, composing a harmonious future shaped by data-driven dreams.
